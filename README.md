## About this repo

In this repo, I create 2 Annotations to hold metadata about Author Information and Information about Class Methods.

I used these 2 Annotations to set Author information and set Some Metadata about methods inside this sample class.

In the [Run.java](https://github.com/cagritrk/JavaAnnotations/blob/master/src/com/cagri/app/Run.java) file, I used this information from the `Program` class that I made up to run a method with version that I want.
